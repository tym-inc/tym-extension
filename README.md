## ðŸ‘€ What does my teammate see?

They see your question and code snippets in a web-vscode and can easily browse your code! (even you have uncommitted changes)

## ðŸ”’Â Security

Our servers have no access to your code but we store the question, highlighted code snippets, and terminal dump. Our extension just commits your current code to your repo with a hidden git ref. So only people who have access to your Github repository can open the link. Learn more [here](https://www.notion.so/Committing-without-REALLY-committing-0f94a5252a104937b1dade1af6fc36b4).
